# YouTube’s KPI and Experimentation

## User Journey
I have been using YouTube for several years, and it has become an essential part of my daily routine. Initially, I started using YouTube to watch music videos and tutorials, but over time, it has evolved into a platform that offers a vast array of content to suit my interests. Here are the reasons I enjoy using YouTube:

- **Content Diversity**: YouTube offers a wide variety of content, including music, educational videos, entertainment, and more, catering to different tastes and preferences.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: YouTube’s algorithm provides me with personalized video suggestions based on my viewing history, which keeps me engaged and helps me discover new creators and topics.
- **Accessibility**: With both free and premium options, YouTube allows me to access content anywhere and anytime.
- **Community Interaction**: Features like comments and live chats during streams make the experience interactive and engaging.

As a platform, YouTube also stands out for its partnerships, such as bundling YouTube Premium with services like Google Fi and promotions through other carriers. To maintain its competitive edge and improve user satisfaction, I propose the following experiments.

## Experiment 1: YouTube’s Music Bundle vs. Existing Premium Offers - A Revenue Sign-Up Experiment

**Objective:** Explore the potential of bundling YouTube Premium with a music-specific offer to attract users who primarily use YouTube for music streaming. This could compete with other music streaming services and increase sign-ups.

**Null Hypothesis:** The music-specific bundle does not perform better than the existing Premium offers in terms of sign-up revenue.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The music-specific bundle performs better than the existing Premium offers in terms of sign-up revenue.

**Leading Metric:** Number of new users signing up after launching the music-specific bundle.

**Lagging Metric:** Increase in total sign-up revenue.

**Test Cell Allocation:**
- **50%**: Users exposed to the music-specific bundle.
- **50%**: Users exposed to the existing Premium offers.

## Experiment 2: Friend Video Sharing and User Engagement Tracking

**Objective:** Introduce a feature that allows users to see and share what videos their friends are watching. This could foster community engagement and enhance content discovery.

**Null Hypothesis:** Viewing and sharing friends’ video activity does not significantly impact user engagement.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Viewing and sharing friends’ video activity significantly increases user engagement.

**Leading Metric:** Frequency of users interacting with the video-sharing feature.

**Lagging Metric:** Percentage of users continuing to engage with shared videos and the platform over time.

**Test Cell Allocation:**
- **50%**: Users with access to the video-sharing feature.
- **50%**: Users without access to the video-sharing feature.

## Experiment 3: Changing Sign-Up Ads to Enhance User Engagement

**Objective:** Test whether a personalized ad, such as “Your friend just liked this video, want to check it out?”, increases sign-ups and engagement compared to the standard “Try YouTube Premium free for 1 month” offer.

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no significant difference in user sign-up rates between the “Try YouTube Premium free for 1 month” and “Your friend just liked this video” ads.

**Alternative Hypothesis:** Users exposed to the “Your friend just liked this video” ad have a higher sign-up rate and engagement.

**Leading Metric:** Time spent on YouTube after signing up.

**Lagging Metric:** Percentage of users converting from free to premium subscribers.

**Test Cell Allocation:**
- **50%**: Users shown the “Try YouTube Premium free for 1 month” ad.
- **50%**: Users shown the “Your friend just liked this video” ad.

## Summary
These experiments aim to:
1. Boost sign-ups with targeted bundles and offers.
2. Increase engagement through social and sharing features.
3. Enhance sign-up rates and retention with personalized ads.

By systematically testing these ideas, YouTube can continue to innovate and maintain its position as a leading content platform.
